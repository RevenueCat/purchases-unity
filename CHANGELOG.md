## 5.0.0
**RevenueCat Purchases Unity v5** is here!! 😻

This latest release updates the Android SDK dependency from v5 to [v6](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-android/releases/tag/6.0.0) to use BillingClient 5. This version of BillingClient brings an entire new subscription model which has resulted in large changes across the entire SDK.

### Migration Guides
- See [Android Native - 5.x to 6.x Migration](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/android-native-5x-to-6x-migration) for a
  more thorough explanation of the new Google subscription model announced with BillingClient 5 and how to take
  advantage of it in V6. This guide includes tips on product setup with the new model.

### New `SubscriptionOption` concept

#### Purchasing
In v4, a Google Play Android `Package` or `StoreProduct` represented a single purchaseable entity, and free trials or intro
offers would automatically be applied to the purchase if the user was eligible.

Now, in Unity v5, a Google Play Android `Package` or `StoreProduct` represents a duration of a subscription and contains all the ways to purchase that duration -- any offers and its base plan. Each of these purchase options are `SubscriptionOption`s.
When passing a `Package` to `purchasePackage()` or `StoreProduct` to `purchaseStoreProduct()`, the SDK will use the following logic to choose which
`SubscriptionOption` to purchase:
- Filters out offers with "rc-ignore-offer" tag
- Uses `SubscriptionOption` with the longest free trial or cheapest first phase
    - Only offers the user is eligible will be applied
- Falls back to base plan

For more control, purchase subscription options with the new `purchaseSubscriptionOption()` method.

#### Models

`StoreProduct` now has a few new properties use for Google Play Android:
- `defaultOption`
  - A subscription option that will automatically be applied when purchasing a `Package` or `StoreProduct`
- `subscriptionOptions`
  - A list of subscription options (could be null)

### Observer Mode

Observer mode is still supported in v5. Other than updating the SDK version, there are no changes required.

### Offline Entitlements

✨ With this new feature, even if our main and backup servers are down, the SDK can continue to process purchases. This is enabled transparently to the user, and when the servers come back online, the SDK automatically syncs the information so it can be visible in the dashboard.

### Offering Metadata

✨ Metadata allows attaching arbitrary information as key/value pairs to your Offering to control how to display your products inside your app. The metadata you configure in an Offering is available from the RevenueCat SDK. For example, you could use it to remotely configure strings on your paywall, or even URLs of images shown on the paywall.

See the [metadata documentation](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/offering-metadata) for more info!

## 4.0.0

RevenueCat Unity SDK v4 is here!!

![Dancing cats](https://media.giphy.com/media/lkbNG2zqzHZUA/giphy.gif)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/revenuecat/purchases-unity/compare/3.5.3...4.0.0)


#### Amazon Appstore Support
We have introduced support for using the Amazon Appstore. We have extensively tested this, and there are some apps using our pre-release Amazon versions in production.

However, we have found some inconsistencies in the way Amazon Appstore prices are reported. We are actively working on patching these inconsistencies.

Please help us help you by reporting any issues you find. [New RevenueCat Issue](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-unity/issues/new/).

You can enable Amazon Appstore support by configuring the SDK using the new `RevenueCatAPIKeyAmazon` field.

For more information around configuration please take a look at the [Amazon Appstore section in our docs](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/amazon-platform-resources). The official [Amazon In-App Purchasing docs](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/in-app-purchasing/iap-overview.html) also contain very valuable information, especially around testing and best practices.

⚠️ ⚠️ Important ⚠️ ⚠️ In order to use Unity IAP < 4.4.0 with RevenueCat in Observer mode,
you need to use the `Purchases-UnityIAP.unityPackage`. For Unity IAP >= 4.4.0, you can use the `Purchases.unitypackage` package.

For Amazon installation instructions please follow take a look at the [Amazon instructions document](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-unity/blob/4.0.0/AMAZON-INSTRUCTIONS.md)

#### StoreKit 2 support
This version of the SDK automatically uses StoreKit 2 APIs under the hood only for APIs that the RevenueCat team has determined work better than StoreKit 1.

#### New types and cleaned up naming
New types that wrap native types from Apple, Google and Amazon, and we cleaned up the naming of other types and methods for a more consistent experience.

### Removed APIs
- `Identify` and `CreateAlias` have been removed in favor of `LogIn`.
- `Reset` has been removed in favor of `LogOut`.
- `GetEntitlements` has been removed in favor of `GetOfferings`.
- `AttributionKey` and `Purchases.AddAttributionData` have been removed in favor of `Set<NetworkID> methods`.
