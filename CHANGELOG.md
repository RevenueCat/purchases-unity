### Identity V3:

In this version, weâ€™ve redesigned the way that user identification works. 
Detailed docs about the new system are available [here](https://docs.revenuecat.com/v3.2/docs/user-ids).

#### New methods
- Introduces `LogIn`, a new way of identifying users, which also returns whether a new user has been registered in the system. 
`LogIn` uses a new backend endpoint. 
- Introduces `LogOut`, a replacement for `Reset`. 

#### Deprecations
- deprecates `CreateAlias` in favor of `LogIn`.
- deprecates `Identify` in favor of `LogIn`.
- deprecates `Reset` in favor of `LogOut`.
- deprecates `SetAllowSharingStoreAccount` in favor of dashboard-side configuration.
