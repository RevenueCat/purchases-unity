Unity in-app subscriptions made easy
</p>

# What is purchases-unity?

Purchases Unity is a client for the [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com/) subscription and purchase tracking system. It is an open source framework that provides a wrapper around `StoreKit`, `Google Play Billing` and the RevenueCat backend to make implementing in-app purchases in `Unity` easy.

## Amazon Support
This version of the SDK doesn't have support for Amazon Store. If you would like to use our SDK with Amazon Store, use the version tagged [amazon-latest](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-unity/releases/tag/amazon-latest) and follow the AMAZON-INSTRUCTIONS.md docs to get set up.

## Getting Started
For more detailed information, you can view our complete documentation at [docs.revenuecat.com](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/unity). There are 2 supported mechanisms to install `purchases-unity`:

### Unity Package Manager (UPM)
You can install `purchases-unity` using Unity Package Manager (UPM) through OpenUPM. Note that this system will not currently work if you're using Unity IAP directly. If you are using it, use the .unitypackage instead. Follow these steps:
1. Add [External Dependencies Manager for Unity (EDM4U)](https://github.com/googlesamples/unity-jar-resolver) in your project if you haven't already. To do that:
   - Download the `external-dependency-manager-latest.unitypackage` file from the root of the https://github.com/googlesamples/unity-jar-resolver repo.
   - [Import](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AssetPackagesImport.html) the downloaded `unitypackage` to your project.
2. After that you can install OpenUPM-CLI following the instructions [here](https://openupm.com/docs/getting-started.html) if you haven't already. 
3. Once OpenUPM is installed, you can execute `openupm add com.revenuecat.purchases-unity` in your project root folder which will add the package dependency and the OpenUPM registry to your project and you should be ready to go!

### Import .unitypackage file into your project assets
You can download and import our own `Purchases.unitypackage` from our [releases github page](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-unity/releases). Note that if you are using this plugin alongside Unity IAP, you need to use `Purchases-UnityIAP.unitypackage`.

## Dependencies and Unity IAP
We use StoreKit for iOS and BillingClient for Android. This plugin also depends on [purchases-ios](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-ios), [purchases-android](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-android) and [purchases-hybrid-common](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-hybrid-common). 

[VERSIONS.md](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-unity/blob/main/VERSIONS.md) contains the dependencies versions for each release.

If using this plugin alongside Unity IAP, please check the specific instructions in [our observer mode docs](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/unity#installation-with-unity-iap-side-by-side).
